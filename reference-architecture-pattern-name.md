## Design scope
{: #design-scope}

Following the [Architecture Framework](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-draft/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-taxonomy), RedHat OpenShift on VPC covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

- **Compute:** Bare Metal and Virtual infrastructure
- **Storage:** Primary, Backup, Archive and Migration
- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Edge Gateways, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity and Load Balancing
- **Security:** Data, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure and Endpoint, Threat Detection and Response
- **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery, High Availability
- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Alerting, Management/Orchestration

The Architecture Framework, described in [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro), provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of aspects and domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide to make the necessary design and component choices to ensure you have considered applicable requirements for each aspect and domain. After you have identified the applicable requirements and domains that are in scope, you can evaluate and select the best fit for purpose components for your enterprise cloud solution.

Following the Architecture Framework, the web application on openshift vpc covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

| Network            | Establish clear network segmentation between public-facing components and backend systems, enforcing strict access controls and reducing the attack surface. Provide network isolation with the ability to separate applications based on attributes such as data classification, public (Internet facing) versus internal services and business functions. Network connectivity to IBM Cloud data centers to provide access to monitor & manage the application’s IaaS/PaaS from the customer’s premise to the operations teams. Ensure low latency and high throughput to deliver a seamless shopping experience, minimizing page load times and providing swift access to content across geographical locations. The E-Commerce application should deliver web content, such as images, videos, scripts and other assets with improved performance, reliability, and scalability to geographically distributed users. The components of the E-Commerce application are broken down into smaller, independent services that leverages cloud services which enhances connectivity, scalability, and resilience. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Managing the complexity of communication between each service providing features like load balancing, tracing, and monitoring. Implement redundancy measures (e.g., multiple data centers, server clusters) to ensure continuous service availability, with failover mechanisms in place to mitigate downtime. Ensure robust security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and encryption protocols, to protect data in transitaintain the integrity of the network. |  |
| Storage            | Utilize high-performance storage solutions. Employ caching mechanisms to reduce latency for frequently accessed data. Implement workload optimization techniques to ensure efficient resource utilization. Utilize containerized architecture such as OpenShift to easily scale resources horizontally.
