# Architecture decisions for storage
{: #storage-decisions}

<!-- Below is a placeholder for all compute domain decisions.  Remove the domains that are not in scope.  If there are decisions
that need to be added (e.g. platform dependent) add additional rows-->

Data storage for this application focuses on multizone region high availability and disaster recovery. The following are storage architecture decisions for the Red Hat OpenShift on VPC storage pattern:
