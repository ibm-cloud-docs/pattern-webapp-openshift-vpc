## Design scope

{: #design-scope}

Following the [Architecture Framework](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-draft/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-taxonomy), RedHat OpenShift on VPC covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

<!-- include all aspectsand domains relavant to the pattern below -->

- **Compute:** Bare Metal and Virtual infrastructure
- **Storage:** Primary, Backup, Archive and Migration
- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Edge Gateways, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity and Load Balancing
- **Security:** Data, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure and Endpoint, Threat Detection and Response
- **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery, High Availability
- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Alerting, Management/Orchestration

The Architecture Framework, described in [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro), provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of aspects and domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide to make the necessary design and component choices to ensure you have considered applicable requirements for each aspect and domain. After you have identified the applicable requirements and domains that are in scope, you can evaluate and select the best fit for purpose components for your enterprise cloud solution.

Following the Architecture Framework, the web application on openshift vpc covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:
